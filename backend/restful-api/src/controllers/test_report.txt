Testing on computeScore
	Kaiheng Luo
computeScore(targetWord,guessWord)

Input
	Design: both inputs are strings containing 5 letters
	Actual: no limits on the string for targetWord and guessWord. They could have any sized string value. 

	However, the program only compares the first 5 element in the string. 

Output
	Actual: the program will take the first 5 element of both strings, and compare them. Does not matter if the string contains at least 5 letters, if the 
			strings are the same within the first 5, it will return [2,2,2,2,2]
